Buzzier Beehouses
=================

This Minecraft resource pack aims only one thing: replace Forestry beehouse and
apiary textures with a fresh beehive texture from 1.15+ to Minecraft 1.12.2 packs

The beehouse becomes an oak beehive and apiary becomes a spruce one. 
This is purely my taste but I love spruce wood and materials from it.

This texture pack works better with the 
[New Textures](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/new-textures)
pack by mirosmir and I definitely recommend to use with it.

Usage
-----

Just drop buzzier-beehouses.zip into the resourcepacks folder of your Minecraft
instance. Dropping files to the Minecraft window is not working in these versions.

If you use this along with other resource packs that is not New Textures pack,
ensure you move this texture pack to the top of the list.

The textures I using here are not original at all. Oak beehive texture is taken
from the original Minecraft textures and spruce hive textue is taken from the
awesome [Buzzier Bees](https://github.com/team-abnormals/buzzier-bees) project 
by Team Abnormals. All rights reserved for these people. 

Please buy Minecraft yourself if you did not do it before and also support

beautiful and exciting mods like Buzzier Bees, Berry Goods, Environmental and
many more. Check out their [Curseforge page](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/teamabnormals/projects) also!
